##Introduction

*Leptograpsus variegatus* is a species of small shore crab found throughout the Southern Pacific, including on the shores of western Australia where the crabs dataset was collected [@campbell1974]. These crabs play an important role in the flow of nutrients through mangrove ecosystems, where they break down mangrove leaves and provide particulate organic matter to many species of detritivores [@camilleri1992].

#Data

Data for this project was originally collected and published in @campbell1974.

##Results

Results of the PCA demonstrated some distinction between blue and orange morphs along the first principal component, and a larger distinction between males and females along the second axis of variation as seen in Figure 2.
