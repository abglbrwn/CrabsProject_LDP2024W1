# Project_LDP2024W1
This project was created for the Living Data Project Fall 2024 productivity and reproducibility in ecology and evolution course. 

In this project I am recreating some of the analyses from Campbell and Mahon (1974) using the "crabs" dataset from the same paper which is available through the MASS R package.
